In the 2 courses I conducted with Comunidad IT, I **trained over 40 students** in **fundamental programming concepts**, developing skills in **logical reasoning** and **pseudocode analysis**. Through an introduction to **JavaScript**, the students gained practical knowledge.

My focus was on providing a solid foundation for software development, with an emphasis on problem-solving and collaborative work.
