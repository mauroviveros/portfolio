This course marked my **first experience in development**, where I learned the fundamentals of programming and participated in my **first team projects**. Acquiring knowledge in *agile methodologies* (**SCRUM**), understanding the importance of collaborative work. I also explored the use of **modern frameworks**, such as **React Native**, applying concepts of *user experience (UX/UI)* and best practices in interface design. Additionally, I learned how to **consume APIs** for integrating data into mobile applications.
